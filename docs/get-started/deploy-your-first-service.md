# Deploy your first service
Deploying your first service in Coolify helps you understand one-click resources and service routing.

In this guide, you will deploy **Umami** (an open source analytics tool) from the one-click resource list.

This path is ideal for a first service deployment because:
- setup is fast and beginner-friendly
- no manual Docker Compose setup is required
- you can verify success by opening the login page

## Before you start
Make sure:
- Coolify is installed and accessible
- you have at least one connected server in Coolify (if you are self-hosting, you can use the same server where Coolify runs which will be `localhost`)
- Coolify proxy is running on your server

If you are not ready yet, first follow:
- [Start with Self-hosted](/get-started/start-with-self-hosted)
- [Start with Coolify Cloud](/get-started/start-with-cloud)


## Deploy your first Umami service
### 1. Check if Coolify proxy is running
On the Coolify dashboard:
- click **Servers** on the left sidebar
- click on your server name
- check if it says **Proxy is running**

If it says **Proxy is stopped**, click **Start Proxy**.

---

### 2. Create your first project
On the Coolify dashboard:
- click **New Project**
- enter a project name (example: `my-first-project`)
- click **Continue**

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Create a project in Coolify" />

::: tip Tip
If you already have a project, skip this step and continue to Step 3.

---

### 3. Create a new resource
Open your project and click **Create New Resource**.

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Create new resource in Coolify project" />

---

### 4. Choose Umami from service list
In the one-click resource list:
- search for **Umami**
- click **Umami**

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Select Umami from one-click services list" />

---

### 5. Deploy
Click the **Deploy** button.

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Deploy Umami service" />

Coolify will pull all required Docker images for Umami and start the containers.

::: tip Tip
Building is not required for one-click services. All one-click services use prebuilt Docker images.

### 6. Visit the service URL
After deployment completes:
- open the generated application URL in Coolify
- you should see the Umami login page

Default login credentials:
- username: `admin`
- password: `umami`

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Umami login page after deployment" />


## Custom domain (optional)
If you want to use your own domain:
- click the pencil icon next to the domain field
- replace the generated domain with your own domain
- keep the service port in configuration (example: `https://domain.com:3000`)

When visiting in browser, use:
- `https://domain.com`

The `:3000` part is for internal routing configuration in Coolify.

For custom domains, make sure:
- your domain DNS record points to your server IP address
- the domain is added in Coolify with `https://`
- ports `80` and `443` are open on your server firewall


## Common first-deploy issues
### 1. Service link does not open
Check:
- DNS record points to your server IP (if using your own domain)
- server firewall allows port `80` and `443`
- Coolify proxy is running (follow [step 1](#_1-check-if-coolify-proxy-is-running))


### 2. Login fails
Check:
- you are using the default credentials (`admin` / `umami`) before changing them
- keyboard input is correct (no extra spaces)


### 3. Browser shows site not secure
This can happen if you are using the auto-generated `sslip.io` domain, because TLS certificate issuance for shared/testing domains can be rate-limited.

If you are using your own domain, make sure:
- DNS is pointed correctly to your server IP
- the domain is added in Coolify with `https://` so it will be like `https://example.com`
