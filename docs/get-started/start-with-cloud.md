# Start with Coolify Cloud
Coolify Cloud is the managed way to use Coolify.

This path is ideal if you want:
- faster onboarding
- less control-plane maintenance
- the same core Coolify feature set without self-hosting the Coolify instance

If you are still deciding between Cloud and self-hosted, read [Choose your path](/get-started/choose-your-path) first.

## How Cloud works
In Coolify Cloud, the Coolify instance (dashboard, control plane, and related services) runs on infrastructure managed by the Coolify team.

You **do not** get direct access to that managed infrastructure.

The main benefit is that you do not need to allocate CPU, RAM, or storage on your own servers for running Coolify itself.
Your servers are used for your workloads (apps, databases, and services).


## Before you start
Use this checklist before starting with Cloud.

### 1. Your own server(s) are required
Coolify Cloud does **not** provide workload servers.
You must bring your own server infrastructure for apps, databases, and services.

Your server can be:
- VPS
- dedicated server
- virtual machine
- old laptop
- Raspberry Pi

::: info Note
If you haven't picked a server provider yet, consider using [Hetzner](https://coolify.io/hetzner). You can even use our [referral link](https://coolify.io/hetzner) to support the project.

### 2. Server access requirements
For connecting servers to Coolify Cloud, make sure:
- SSH access is available from the internet
- Docker engine can be installed on the target server
- `root` user access (or `sudo` privileges) is available

Use:
- [OpenSSH guide](/knowledge-base/server/openssh)
- [Firewall guide](/knowledge-base/server/firewall)

::: warning Important
Coolify Cloud manages the Coolify instance. You still manage and secure your own servers and workloads.

## Get started with Coolify Cloud
### 1. Create your Cloud account
Visit [app.coolify.io/register](https://app.coolify.io/register) and create your account using your email address.

This email is tied to your Cloud account. If you need account help later, contact the Coolify team using the same email address.

---

### 2. Choose your subscription plan
Coolify Cloud is a pay-as-you-go service. Pricing starts at **$5/month** and scales with the number of servers you want to connect (**$3/month** per additional server).

Your subscription is based on connected server count, so choose the number of servers you need and complete payment.

After this step, Cloud onboarding starts automatically.

---

### 3. Add an SSH private key (first onboarding step)
This is the first onboarding step in Coolify Cloud.

You can either:
- use an existing SSH key, or
- create a new SSH key

If you use an existing key:
- choose **Existing key**
- paste your private SSH key

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Add private key in Coolify Cloud" />

If you create a new key:
- choose **Create new key**
- copy the generated public key
- add it to `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your server

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Private key setup in Coolify Cloud" />

---

### 4. Add your server (next onboarding step)
Now add the server you want to deploy to:
- give your server a name
- enter your server public IP address
- select SSH port
- select server user account

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Add server in Coolify Cloud" />
<br />
<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Server connection form in Coolify Cloud" />

Then click **Validate Server & Install Docker Engine**.
Coolify Cloud will validate connection and install required components on your server.

<ZoomableImage src="shadow-to-do" alt="Validate server and install docker action" />

After validation succeeds, you will see the server status update in onboarding.

### 5. Deploy your first application
Once your server is validated, deploy your first resource by following one of these guides:
- [Deploy your first app](/get-started/deploy-your-first-app)
- [Deploy your first database](/get-started/deploy-your-first-database)
- [Deploy your first service](/get-started/deploy-your-first-service)


## Shared responsibility model
Coolify Cloud manages the Coolify control plane. You manage the servers and workloads you connect to it.

| Area | Managed by Coolify Cloud | Managed by you |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Coolify control plane hosting (`app.coolify.io`) | Yes | No |
| Coolify control plane updates and maintenance | Yes | No |
| Coolify control plane backups | Yes | No |
| Server OS updates and security hardening | No | Yes |
| Application and database runtime/data | No | Yes |
| Application backups and restore| No | Yes |


## Quick answers
### Do I get Cloud-only features?
No. Cloud and self-hosted share the same core feature set.

### Does Cloud back up my application data?
No. Cloud backs up the Coolify Cloud instance data. Your application data backups remain your responsibility.

### Can I use my own domain for the Cloud dashboard?
No. The Cloud dashboard is provided at `app.coolify.io`.

### Will my apps stop if my Cloud subscription is paused?
Your apps keep running on your own servers. Coolify dashboard access will be restricted, but your running workloads are still on your infrastructure without any issue.

### Do I need to whitelist Cloud IPs?
For some environments, yes. Allow `SSH` port access to the Cloud IPs: [IPv4](https://coolify.io/ipv4.txt) and [IPv6](https://coolify.io/ipv6.txt).


## Troubleshooting
### SSH key is not working (permission errors)
If authentication fails:
- make sure the correct public key is in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on your server
- make sure key/file permissions are correct on server
- verify you are using the correct SSH user, IP, and port
- confirm the key has no passphrase

---

### Server validation fails because of plan limits
If Cloud says you exceeded allowed connected servers for your current plan:
- remove an existing connected server, or
- upgrade your plan to support more connected servers
- If the issue still persists after trying the above, send an email to **[hi@coollabs.io](mailto:hi@coollabs.io)** clearly describing the problem.
