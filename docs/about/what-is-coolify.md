# What is Coolify
Coolify is an open source platform that helps you build, deploy, and manage applications on your own servers.

It gives you a PaaS-like experience while keeping the infrastructure in your control.


## High-level overview
At a high level, Coolify lets you:
- connect your servers over SSH
- deploy applications, databases, and services with Docker
- manage domains, SSL, logs, and deployments from one dashboard
- keep workloads portable without platform lock-in


## What Coolify is
Coolify is a **control plane** for self-hosted infrastructure.

It helps you operate:
- applications (from Git, Dockerfile, Compose, or prebuilt image)
- databases and one-click services
- multi-server environments

Coolify automates day-to-day operations like deployments, environment management, health checks, and routing.


## What Coolify is not
Coolify is **not** a hosting provider for your application workloads.

You still bring your own servers (VPS, bare metal, home lab, cloud VM, etc.).

If you choose self-hosted Coolify, you are responsible for:
- server security and hardening
- network/firewall setup
- backups and recovery strategy
- operating system updates


## Why people choose Coolify
People usually choose Coolify because it combines:
- control of self-hosting
- lower infrastructure cost compared to many managed PaaS providers
- open source transparency
- no feature paywall between self-hosted and Cloud product experience


## Self-hosted or Coolify Cloud
You can use Coolify in two ways:
- **Self-hosted** - you run the Coolify instance yourself
- **Coolify Cloud** - the Coolify team runs the Coolify instance for you

In both cases, your apps run on your own servers.
